# Tools-for-Data-Science-week-6-assignment
In this notebook, several exercises were completed to practice various data science concepts. First, a markdown cell was created with the title of the notebook. Then, an introduction was added to provide an overview of what the notebook would cover.

Next, two markdown cells were added to list data science languages and libraries respectively. These were formatted as bullet points for easy readability.

A table was also created using markdown syntax to list various data science tools along with their descriptions. This table makes it easy to compare and contrast different tools used in the field.

After that, a markdown cell was created to introduce arithmetic expression examples. Two code cells were then added to practice multiplication and addition in Python.

A markdown cell was then inserted to list the objectives of the notebook. These objectives give the reader a clear understanding of what they can expect to learn from this notebook.

Finally, a markdown cell was added to indicate the author's name. This gives credit to the person who created the notebook and allows readers to contact them if necessary.
